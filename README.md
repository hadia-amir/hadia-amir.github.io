<h1> <strong> HENNA </strong> </h1>

<h2 style="color:brown"> What is it? </h2>
<p> Henna, also called <i> mehndi </i>, is a natural dye made from the leaves of the henna plant. It is used to create patterns on the skin, especially on hands and feet. When it dries, it leaves a reddish-brown stain. Mehndi is enjoyed around the world as both art and tradition. It is often seen as a symbol of joy and celebration, especially at weddings where brides and guests wear mehndi as part of the tradition. In many cultures, the designs are believed to bring good luck, blessings, and protection. </p>

<h2 style="color:brown"> Why I like it? </h2>
<p> I enjoy henna because it is creative and relaxing. Making patterns with the cone feels peaceful, and I love seeing how the designs turn into beautiful stains on the skin. It is a fun way to share art with friends and family during special occasions. It allows me to use my creativity and passion for art in something that is culturally significant and close to my heart, while also giving me complete freedom of what I want to create. </p>
