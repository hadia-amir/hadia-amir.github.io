<h1> <strong> HENNA </strong> </h1>

<h2 style="color:brown"> What is it? </h2>
<p> Henna, also called <i> mehndi </i>, is a natural dye made from the leaves of the henna plant. It is used to create patterns on the skin, especially on hands and feet. When it dries, it leaves a reddish-brown stain. Mehndi is enjoyed around the world as both art and tradition.</p>

<h2 style="color:brown"> History </h2>
<p> Henna has been used for thousands of years in South Asia, the Middle East, and North Africa. In the past, it was used for decoration, cooling the skin, and even as simple medicine. Now it has become a part of celebrations, where people make designs during weddings and festivals. Hennaâ€™s long history shows how one plant has shaped culture and beauty across many places. 

<p> Mehndi is very important in weddings, Eid, Diwali, and other celebrations. It is seen as a symbol of happiness, blessings, and good luck. Brides often have detailed designs that cover their hands and arms. Applying mehndi is also a social event where family and friends gather, talk, and celebrate together. </p>

<h2 style="color:brown"> Why I like it? </h2>
<p> I enjoy henna because it is creative and relaxing. Making patterns with the cone feels peaceful, and I love seeing how the designs turn into beautiful stains on the skin. It is a fun way to share art with friends and family during special occasions. </p>
